> âš  **The module is still under semver 1.0.0**: This means that big changes in the methods / import architecture can happen at any time. Make sure your code is compatible with the new version after updating.

Browse EcoleDirecte's private API with the module of your dreams. But first, [read the docs](https://edjs.gitbook.io/).

`ed.js` is a Promise-based module, built on TypeScript for a better IntelliSense and type-guarded, solid features. It keeps evolving and new features are being added. This is the most complete EcoleDirecte client you'll find at that time. After the website itself, of course.

## Examples

### Get the homework of a day

```javascript
import { Session } from "ecoledirecte.js";

// Create a new Session.
const session = new Session("identifiant", "motdepasse");

// Bring your session to life!
const account = await session.login().catch(err => {
	console.error("This login did not go well.");
});

// Is is a student account?
if (!account || account.type !== "student") throw new Error("Not a student!");

// Get the homework due for a specific date as a simplified array
const homework = await account.getHomework({ dates: "2021-01-14" });

// Every piece of data from the API is reformated  (eg: base64 string are
// converted to text/HTML). The raw data remains always available as _raw
console.log(homework[2].contenuDeSeance.content.text);
```

### Introduction to events

Events can be used to do something when something else happens, in real-time. (very specific, as you can tell)
As an example, the following will log the method and the url each time `ed.js` sends a request to the EcoleDirecte servers.

```javascript
import { events } from "ecoledirecte.js";

events.on("request", ({ method, url }) => console.log(method, url));
// POST https://api.ecoledirecte.com/v3/login.awp
// POST https://api.ecoledirecte.com/v3/eleves/4179/timeline.awp
// ...
```

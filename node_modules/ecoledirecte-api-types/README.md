# ecoledirecte-api-types

If you need a EcoleDirecte client for JavaScript, this isn't the right place! This way: [ecoledirecte.js](https://github.com/a2br/ecoledirecte.js).

This is the list of the types related to EcoleDirecte's private API. It is still under development and is completed as it is needed.
Feel free to submit a PR, we'd appreciate some help!
